# Student reports generator

Generate mail-mergey type reports for a teacher's students using an Angular app.
This app is currently in pre alpha development and can be considered a prototype.

Most browsers don't like referring to other files when you're just viewing a file. This means that you're probably going to need some sort of web server to use this. I recommend node's http-server. If you have npm installed, just run `npm install --global http-server` and then run `http-server` from within the project directory. 

## Usage
Serve index.html from an http server

## Development Environment
This project uses an [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file to ensure that tabs, line endings etc are kept the same across development environments. You can find a plugin for your text editor [here](http://editorconfig.org/#download).
